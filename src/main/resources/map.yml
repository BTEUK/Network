# Lobby map configuration.
# Must be enabled for the map to be active.
enabled: false

# Bounds of the map in both Minecraft and IRL coordinates.
# Minecraft coordinates must be block coordinates (no decimals).
# The coordinates must be the coordinate of the outside edge of the map.
# For example if the edge of the map in the positive x direction is between the border of 23 and 24, then 24 is the edge.
# Irl coordinates must be in decimal format.
# The map must be rectangular.
# The coordinates will be used to indicate the outer corner of the block for the specific corner.
# The y-coordinate will not be relevant, the map will work at any elevation.
# If any of the bounds are not filled in the map will be disabled.
# Latitude has a range of 90 (north) to -90 (south)
# Longitude has a range of -180 (west) to 180 (east)
# The cardinal directions used for the bounds names are Minecraft cardinal directions.
