##Proxy
Features such as global chat and discord integration require a Velocity Proxy, running the [Proxy](https://github.com/BTEUK/Proxy) plugin. If you are planning to run multiple connected servers with the Network plugin it is highly advised to use this plugin.
##Dependencies
- [WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard)
- [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit) or [FAWE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/)

##PlotSystem
The Network plugin is the backbone of the [PlotSystem](https://github.com/BTEUK/Network), it adds the GUIs and cross-server compatibility that make the PlotSystem function on a multi-server Network.
